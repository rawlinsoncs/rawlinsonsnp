## What Is the Student Nutrition Program?

The Rawlinson Student Nutrition Program (SNP) provides a **daily snack to every student** at the school.

Students can receive a snack **regardless of whether a family has submitted an opt-in form**.  
This approach helps ensure all students are supported during the school day.

The program exists to:
- Support student wellbeing
- Promote equitable access to food
- Reduce barriers for families

---

## How the Program Works

The Student Nutrition Program is supported through:
- Public funding
- Food donations
- Community support

Much of the program is run by **volunteers**, with support from school administration.

Because a significant portion of the food is **donated and perishable**:
- Menus may change week to week
- Substitutions are not always possible
- Items are sometimes prioritized to reduce waste

The goal is **consistency and equity**, not perfection.

---

## What Does the Snack Include?

Each snack day includes **two components**, following Student Nutrition Program guidelines:

**1. Vegetables or fruit**

**2. One of the following:**
- Whole grain products  
- Protein foods  
- Milk or milk alternatives  

Specific items vary depending on availability, seasonality, and food safety requirements.

---

## Nutrition Standards

All snacks follow nutrition standards set by the TDSB and the City of Toronto.

These standards include guidance around:
- Sugar and sodium limits
- Whole grain ingredients
- Appropriate food categories for student nutrition programs

## Dietary Needs and Allergies

We take dietary needs and allergies seriously.

- Students with allergies or medical dietary needs receive **appropriate substitutions**
- Temporary dietary needs (for example, related to religious observance) can be accommodated when possible

**Important notes:**
- Allergy or medical concerns must be communicated **in writing** through the school
- Allergy concerns cannot be lifted based on verbal requests alone
- If a student does not receive a substitution item, their dietary needs do not require one

If you have questions about your child’s dietary needs, please contact the **school office**.

---

## How the Program Is Funded

The Student Nutrition Program is supported through:
- Public funding
- Food donations
- Community contributions

Donated food often includes fresh, perishable items such as fruit and dairy.  
Additional items may be purchased to supplement donations when needed.

---

## How Families Can Help

Families can support the program by:
- [Volunteering time when possible](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9vXzS8igf1ctnruGFHIYfP6KN_mPStFYAoPrZKV8o9Lds9g/viewform?usp=header)

Every form of support helps keep the program running smoothly.

## How Snack Distribution Works (Behind the Scenes)

> **The Student Nutrition Program serves approximately 720 students every school day, five days a week.**

Providing a daily snack at this scale requires coordination, care, and consistency. Below is a look at how the program runs each day and where volunteers are involved.

---

### Daily Snack Distribution (Morning)

Snack distribution happens every school day and is designed to be efficient, predictable, and finished before classes begin.

**Around 8:20 a.m., volunteers arrive at the school.**  
They collect the snack bins used the previous day and lay them out in order by classroom. If a bin is missing, it is replaced so every class is accounted for.

**All bins are sanitized.**  
Before any food is added, bins are cleaned and prepared for use.

**Snacks for the day are gathered from storage.**  
Food is retrieved from the pantry or refrigerators. On some days, fruit or vegetables need to be washed or portioned by weight before distribution.

**Snacks are carefully portioned by classroom.**  
Items are counted out based on class size. Depending on what is served, this may include:

- An apple and a cheese string  
- A yogurt or fruit cup, **plus a disposable spoon for every student**  
- Bread sticks with WOW butter, alongside fruit  

Quantities are adjusted on the fly if supplies are limited, ensuring every class receives what they need.

**Dietary alternatives are added.**  
Students requiring substitutions receive them in **clearly labeled bags placed inside classroom bins**. These alternatives vary depending on the snack being served that day.

**Bins are distributed.**  
- Kindergarten bins are delivered directly to classrooms  
- All other bins are placed on tables near the office for teacher pickup  

**Cleanup happens immediately.**  
Cardboard is broken down and placed in recycling, and the space is reset.

The goal is for all distribution to be complete by **approximately 9:15 a.m.**, so snacks are ready when classes need them.

Volunteers are onboarded before helping, and **no food handling certification is required**. [Complete the volunteer form for more information](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9vXzS8igf1ctnruGFHIYfP6KN_mPStFYAoPrZKV8o9Lds9g/viewform?usp=header).

### Moving Food Deliveries (A Separate Volunteer Role)

Moving food deliveries is a distinct task from daily distribution and is often handled by different volunteers.

**What this role involves**

Food deliveries are signed for by office staff but arrive on the **main floor**. Volunteers then move items to appropriate storage locations, including:

- The pantry on the second floor  
- Refrigerators in the lunchroom for dairy and other perishables  

Deliveries can include **dozens of cases** containing items such as:

- Apples or other fruit  
- Yogurt tubes  
- Granola bars or cereal products  
- Individually packaged snacks  

Cases can range in weight from **a few pounds up to approximately 45 pounds**.

**Delivery timing varies by vendor**

- **TFSS**  
  - Deliveries are moving to Wednesdays between **11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m.**  
  - Arrival times can be unpredictable and may fall outside the delivery window  

- **Healthy Selections**  
  - Delivery dates are selected by the SNP coordinator  
  - Deliveries typically arrive within the agreed-upon window  

- **Millennium Bakery**  
  - Delivers reliably on Wednesday mornings  

Because dairy and other perishable items need to be refrigerated as soon as possible, timing matters.

Volunteers helping with deliveries are onboarded, and **no food handling certification is required**. [Complete the volunteer form for more information](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9vXzS8igf1ctnruGFHIYfP6KN_mPStFYAoPrZKV8o9Lds9g/viewform?usp=header).

### Why This Matters

Providing a daily snack to **over 700 students** helps reduce hunger, supports focus in the classroom, and contributes to a calmer learning environment for everyone.

The process is well thought out and reliable. It works because of community involvement.

Volunteering offers:
- A meaningful way to support students  
- A first-hand look at how Rawlinson operates day to day  
- A tangible way to strengthen the school community  

This is not about fixing a broken system — it is about **showing up for students together**.
