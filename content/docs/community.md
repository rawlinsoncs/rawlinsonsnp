## What Is the Student Nutrition Program?

The Rawlinson Student Nutrition Program (SNP) provides a **daily snack to every student** at the school.

Students can receive a snack **regardless of whether a family has submitted an opt-in form**.  
This approach helps ensure all students are supported during the school day.

The program exists to:
- Support student wellbeing
- Promote equitable access to food
- Reduce barriers for families

---

## How the Program Works

The Student Nutrition Program is supported through:
- Public funding
- Food donations
- Community support

Much of the program is run by **volunteers**, with support from school administration.

Because a significant portion of the food is **donated and perishable**:
- Menus may change week to week
- Substitutions are not always possible
- Items are sometimes prioritized to reduce waste

The goal is **consistency and equity**, not perfection.

---

## What Does the Snack Include?

Each snack day includes **two components**, following Student Nutrition Program guidelines:

**1. Vegetables or fruit**

**2. One of the following:**
- Whole grain products  
- Protein foods  
- Milk or milk alternatives  

Specific items vary depending on availability, seasonality, and food safety requirements.

---

### Why This Matters

Providing a daily snack to **over 700 students** helps reduce hunger, supports focus in the classroom, and contributes to a calmer learning environment for everyone.

The process is well thought out and reliable. It works because of community involvement. Maintaining this level of support for over 700 students requires consistent volunteer participation and funding throughout the school year.

Volunteering offers:
- A meaningful way to support students  
- A first-hand look at how Rawlinson operates day to day  
- A tangible way to strengthen the school community  

This is not about fixing a broken system — it is about **showing up for students together**.

---

## Nutrition Standards

All snacks follow nutrition standards set by the TDSB and the City of Toronto.

These standards include guidance around:
- Sugar and sodium limits
- Whole grain ingredients
- Appropriate food categories for student nutrition programs

## Dietary Needs and Allergies

We take dietary needs and allergies seriously.

- Students with allergies or medical dietary needs receive **appropriate substitutions**
- Temporary dietary needs (for example, related to religious observance) can be accommodated when possible

**Important notes:**
- Allergy or medical concerns must be communicated **in writing** through the school
- Allergy concerns cannot be lifted based on verbal requests alone
- If a student does not receive a substitution item, their dietary needs do not require one

If you have questions about your child’s dietary needs, please contact the **school office**.

---

## How the Program Is Funded

The Student Nutrition Program is supported through:
- Public funding
- Food donations
- Community contributions

Donated food often includes fresh, perishable items such as fruit and dairy.  
Additional items may be purchased to supplement donations when needed.

---

## How Families Can Help

Families can support the program by:
- [Volunteering time when possible](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9vXzS8igf1ctnruGFHIYfP6KN_mPStFYAoPrZKV8o9Lds9g/viewform?usp=header)
- [Making financial contributions](https://tfss.ca/donate/schoolsites-snp/) (Receipts available for donations over $10)
- Sharing accurate information within the community
- Expressing appreciation for volunteers and staff

Every form of support helps keep the program running smoothly.

---

## How Snack Distribution Works (Behind the Scenes)

> **The Student Nutrition Program serves approximately 720 students every school day, five days a week.**

Providing a daily snack at this scale requires coordination, care, and consistency. Below is a look at how the program runs each day and where volunteers are involved.

---

### Daily Snack Distribution (Morning)

Snack distribution happens every school day and is designed to be efficient, predictable, and finished before classes begin.

**Around 8:20 a.m., volunteers arrive at the school.**  
They collect the snack bins used the previous day and lay them out in order by classroom. If a bin is missing, it is replaced so every class is accounted for.

**All bins are sanitized.**  
Before any food is added, bins are cleaned and prepared for use.

**Snacks for the day are gathered from storage.**  
Food is retrieved from the pantry or refrigerators. On some days, fruit or vegetables need to be washed or portioned by weight before distribution.

**Snacks are carefully portioned by classroom.**  
Items are counted out based on class size. Depending on what is served, this may include:

- An apple and a cheese string  
- A yogurt or fruit cup, **plus a disposable spoon for every student**  
- Bread sticks with WOW butter, alongside fruit  

Quantities are adjusted on the fly if supplies are limited, ensuring every class receives what they need.

**Dietary alternatives are added.**  
Students requiring substitutions receive them in **clearly labeled bags placed inside classroom bins**. These alternatives vary depending on the snack being served that day.

**Bins are distributed.**  
- Kindergarten bins are delivered directly to classrooms  
- All other bins are placed on tables near the office for teacher pickup  

**Cleanup happens immediately.**  
Cardboard is broken down and placed in recycling, and the space is reset.

The goal is for all distribution to be complete by **approximately 9:15 a.m.**, so snacks are ready when classes need them.

Volunteers are onboarded before helping, and **no food handling certification is required**. [Complete the volunteer form for more information](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9vXzS8igf1ctnruGFHIYfP6KN_mPStFYAoPrZKV8o9Lds9g/viewform?usp=header).

### Moving Food Deliveries (A Separate Volunteer Role)

Moving food deliveries is a distinct task from daily distribution and is often handled by different volunteers.

**What this role involves**

Food deliveries are signed for by office staff but arrive on the **main floor**. Volunteers then move items to appropriate storage locations, including:

- The pantry on the second floor  
- Refrigerators in the lunchroom for dairy and other perishables  

Deliveries can include **dozens of cases** containing items such as:

- Apples or other fruit  
- Yogurt tubes  
- Granola bars or cereal products  
- Individually packaged snacks  

Cases can range in weight from **a few pounds up to approximately 45 pounds**.

**Delivery timing varies by vendor**

- **TFSS**  
  - Deliveries are moving to Wednesdays between **11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m.**  
  - Arrival times can be unpredictable and may fall outside the delivery window  

- **Healthy Selections**  
  - Delivery dates are selected by the SNP coordinator  
  - Deliveries typically arrive within the agreed-upon window  

- **Millennium Bakery**  
  - Delivers reliably on Wednesday mornings  

Because dairy and other perishable items need to be refrigerated as soon as possible, timing matters.

Volunteers helping with deliveries are onboarded, and **no food handling certification is required**. [Complete the volunteer form for more information](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9vXzS8igf1ctnruGFHIYfP6KN_mPStFYAoPrZKV8o9Lds9g/viewform?usp=header).

### What if my child has food allergies?

Every effort will be made to control the school environment to minimize the exposure of identified allergens as part of a prevention plan. For example, all schools are peanut-free. Despite these efforts to reduce the risk of exposure to zero, the Board cannot ensure an allergen-free school environment.

Schools with a nutrition program request that parents submit an allergy/food restriction form at the beginning of the school year so that accommodations can be made. For instance, if a child is allergic to milk, that child is not served milk. If it is an anaphylactic allergy, the bin with food going into that student’s classroom is clearly labelled, kept separate and sanitized daily. Every classroom bin has a class list attached with student allergies identified so that teachers and volunteers are aware of children with allergies. The program coordinator will have access to allergy and food restriction information gathered by the school. Menus are developed with food allergies in mind and ensure that the food preparation area is sanitized daily according to Toronto Public Health Food Safety standards.

---

### How is the food prepared for the student nutrition program?

The program coordinator and/or volunteers prepare the menu and ensure that your child’s food is delivered and served in a safe, clean environment that adheres to Toronto Public Health sanitary standards, including proper refrigeration and daily sanitizing of food preparation areas. Program coordinators must complete training in food safety and student nutrition guidelines. A Toronto Public Health Inspector visits your school’s food preparation space to ensure it complies with all safety regulations and a Toronto Public Health Dietitian visits your school to review and support the best menu possible.

---

### How is my school’s student nutrition program funded?

Provincial and municipal funding cover a small portion of the program costs. Contributions from parents and/or fundraising are necessary to make the program sustainable and meet funding criteria. Your school/Local Nutrition Program Committee may suggest an amount for parents to contribute based on the cost needed to run your school’s program. Nutrition programs are universal and available for all students, regardless of a family’s ability to contribute financially. For information on other funding sources, please contact one of our Nutrition Liaison Officers listed below.

---

### Why does our school need a student nutrition program?

The Toronto District School Board, through its Nutrition Foundation Statement, recognizes the direct relationship between healthy nutrition and academic achievement of students. Research shows that children who participate in student nutrition programs are better able to concentrate, retain and apply information and show positive behavior in the classroom. Through nutrition programs students are more likely to develop eating habits which promote health and help prevent chronic diseases. Student nutrition programs improve learning outcomes, create a sense of belonging and connection, and address hunger in a non-stigmatizing way. They also unlock opportunities for curriculum connections, student leadership, food literacy and hands-on learning, as well as community engagement. They are beneficial for all school communities. Student nutrition is part of our school’s plan to support student success and well-being.

---

### How do I volunteer with the student nutrition program?

Volunteers are vital to the success of school nutrition programs. To volunteer at Rawlinson, we have setup a [volunteer intake form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9vXzS8igf1ctnruGFHIYfP6KN_mPStFYAoPrZKV8o9Lds9g/viewform?usp=header). If this doesn't address your concernt, please speak with your school principal. To ensure the safety of all students, the Toronto District School Board requires police reference checks for all adult volunteers. 

Schools may also welcome secondary school students who wish to volunteer toward their 40 hours of community service required to graduate.
