## What Is the Student Nutrition Program?

The Rawlinson Student Nutrition Program (SNP) provides a **daily snack to every student** at the school.

Students can receive a snack **regardless of whether a family has submitted an opt-in form**.  
This approach helps ensure all students are supported during the school day.

The program exists to:
- Support student wellbeing
- Promote equitable access to food
- Reduce barriers for families

---

## How the Program Works

The Student Nutrition Program is supported through:
- Public funding
- Food donations
- Community support

Much of the program is run by **volunteers**, with support from school administration.

Because a significant portion of the food is **donated and perishable**:
- Menus may change week to week
- Substitutions are not always possible
- Items are sometimes prioritized to reduce waste

The goal is **consistency and equity**, not perfection.

---

## What Does the Snack Include?

Each snack day includes **two components**, following Student Nutrition Program guidelines:

**1. Vegetables or fruit**

**2. One of the following:**
- Whole grain products  
- Protein foods  
- Milk or milk alternatives  

Specific items vary depending on availability, seasonality, and food safety requirements.

---

## Nutrition Standards

All snacks follow nutrition standards set by the TDSB and the City of Toronto.

These standards include guidance around:
- Sugar and sodium limits
- Whole grain ingredients
- Appropriate food categories for student nutrition programs

## Dietary Needs and Allergies

We take dietary needs and allergies seriously.

- Students with allergies or medical dietary needs receive **appropriate substitutions**
- Temporary dietary needs (for example, related to religious observance) can be accommodated when possible

**Important notes:**
- Allergy or medical concerns must be communicated **in writing** through the school
- Allergy concerns cannot be lifted based on verbal requests alone
- If a student does not receive a substitution item, their dietary needs do not require one

If you have questions about your child’s dietary needs, please contact the **school office**.

---

## How the Program Is Funded

The Student Nutrition Program is supported through:
- Public funding
- Food donations
- Community contributions

Donated food often includes fresh, perishable items such as fruit and dairy.  
Additional items may be purchased to supplement donations when needed.
