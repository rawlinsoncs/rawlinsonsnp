## Snack Program Reporting Form

Go to the [Teacher-specific Snack Program Reporting Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdRoEtHOad9SSLyxjuC_P0UjtdTEw9Yn8sncGmdXfXXrlgtTw/viewform?usp=header)

## Teacher Quick Start

**If you only read one section, read this.**

### Please reach out to the Snack Program if:

- You notice a student has a **dietary change** due to an allergy, medical reason, or religious observance.
- Your class requires a **larger quantity of the daily snack**. We typically plan for one item per student, but we can adjust when needed.
- A **large number of students will be away** (for example, a field trip) and will not receive a snack. Ideally, this is shared the day before distribution.
- Your class will be away and you would like snacks **sent earlier, set aside, or stored** for when the class returns (again, ideally the day before).
- You’re noticing **consistent waste** for a particular item and think it might help us adjust future servings.  
  *We see overall waste, but classroom context helps us understand why.*

### You do **not** need to contact us if:

- A parent has **verbally asked** to lift an allergy concern. Allergy changes must come through the office or in writing from a guardian.
- A student has a **one-off dislike** of a snack.
- A parent is looking for contact information for the Snack Program. We maintain a **separate community-facing page** for families.

**How to contact us**
- Use the ✴️ [Teacher-specific Snack Program Reporting Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdRoEtHOad9SSLyxjuC_P0UjtdTEw9Yn8sncGmdXfXXrlgtTw/viewform?usp=header) ✴️.

## What Is the Student Nutrition Program (SNP)?

The Rawlinson Student Nutrition Program provides a **daily snack to every student**, regardless of whether a family has submitted an opt-in form.  
This is an intentional change from previous years.

The program exists to:
- Support student wellbeing
- Ensure **equitable access** to food
- Reduce barriers for families

### How the program works

- The SNP is run primarily by **volunteers**
- Food is funded through:
  - **Toronto Foundation for Student Success (TFSS)** — primarily donated, perishable food such as fruit and dairy
  - **Healthy Selections** — ordered items with more flexibility in portion size
  - **Millennium Bakery** — baked goods
- Because much of the food is **donated**, substitutions are not always possible
- Menus may change based on:
  - Availability
  - Surplus
  - Spoilage risk

Our goal is **consistency and equity**, not perfection.

### Nutrition Guidelines and Program Standards

The Rawlinson Snack Program follows the nutrition standards and guidance set by the TDSB and the City of Toronto.

For reference:
- [**TDSB Student Nutrition – Frequently Asked Questions**](https://www.tdsb.on.ca/Elementary-School/Supporting-You/Student-Nutrition/Frequently-Asked-Questions)
- [**City of Toronto – Student Nutrition Program Nutrition Guidelines**](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/health-wellness-care/health-programs-advice/student-nutrition-program/nutrition-guidelines/)
- [**Toronto Public Health – Student Nutrition Program Guidelines (PDF)**](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/962f-tph-SNPguideline-fs-eng-2017-09-05.pdf)

These guidelines inform what foods can be served, portion sizes, and ingredient requirements.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the bags sometimes added to the classroom bins, and what if my students don’t receive one?

The bags contain **dietary substitutions** for students who require them.

- If a student does not receive a bag, their dietary needs **do not require a substitution**
- If you are unsure, please check with the **office**

Please return the bags to the bin after they have been consumed. This helps reduce waste.

---

### Where do we return the snack bins after snack time?

All snack bins should be returned to the snack tables by the office.

---

### Should a snack be offered to every student in the class?

Yes. A snack should be offered to **every student**, regardless of whether an opt-in form has been submitted.

---

### What does a typical snack include?

Each snack day includes **two components**, following Student Nutrition Program guidelines:

**1. Vegetables or fruit**

**2. One of the following:**
- Whole grain products  
- Protein foods  
- Milk or milk alternatives  

The exact items vary based on availability, seasonality, and funding source.

---

### What if my class is away?

If your class will be away (for example, a field trip), please let us know in advance if possible.  
We can adjust quantities, send snacks early, or store them for when the class returns.

---

### What if a student has no allergy form on file?

Students do **not** need to opt in to receive a snack.

If a student has an allergy or dietary concern:
- Please report it using the form
- Allergy concerns **cannot be lifted** without written confirmation from a guardian or the office

---

### Can I request a specific snack?

You are welcome to make requests, but we **cannot guarantee** specific items.  
Availability and funding sources may limit what we can provide.

---

### What criteria are used for snack items?

Snack items follow **TDSB and City of Toronto Student Nutrition Program guidelines**, including limits on sugar and sodium.

For example, whole grain products are selected using criteria such as:
- Whole grain, whole wheat, or bran listed first on the ingredient list
- **≤ 8 g of sugar per 30 g serving**
- **≤ 10% Daily Value (DV) of sodium per serving**

These standards help ensure snacks support student health while remaining practical to distribute in a school setting.

---

### Why don’t we serve certain items?

We do not have:
- A prep kitchen
- Food handling certifications

For safety reasons — and to comply with Student Nutrition Program guidelines — this limits what we can serve.

---

### Who runs the Snack Program?

With the exception of the principal, office staff, and a teacher liaison, the SNP is run entirely by **volunteers**.  
This includes coordination, packing, distribution, and managing dietary needs.
