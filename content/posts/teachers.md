## Teacher Quick Start

**If you only read one section, read this.**

### Please reach out to the Snack Program if:

- You notice a student has a **dietary change** due to an allergy, medical reason, or religious observance.
- Your class requires a **larger quantity of the daily snack**. We typically plan for one item per student, but we can adjust when needed.
- A **large number of students will be away** (for example, a field trip) and will not receive a snack. Ideally, this is shared the day before distribution.
- Your class will be away and you would like snacks **sent earlier, set aside, or stored** for when the class returns (again, ideally the day before).
- You’re noticing **consistent waste** for a particular item and think it might help us adjust future servings.  
  *We see overall waste, but classroom context helps us understand why.*

### You do **not** need to contact us if:

- A parent has **verbally asked** to lift an allergy concern. Allergy changes must come through the office or in writing from a guardian.
- A student has a **one-off dislike** of a snack.
- A parent is looking for contact information for the Snack Program. We maintain a **separate community-facing page** for families.

**How to contact us**
- A short reporting **form is preferred**
- Email is always OK if the form does not capture what you need

## What Is the Student Nutrition Program (SNP)?

The Rawlinson Student Nutrition Program provides a **daily snack to every student**, regardless of whether a family has submitted an opt-in form.  
This is an intentional change from previous years.

The program exists to:
- Support student wellbeing
- Ensure **equitable access** to food
- Reduce barriers for families

### How the program works

- The SNP is run primarily by **volunteers**
- Food is funded through:
  - **Toronto Foundation for Student Success (TFSS)** — primarily donated, perishable food such as fruit and dairy
  - **Healthy Selections** — ordered items with more flexibility in portion size
  - **Millennium Bakery** — baked goods
- Because much of the food is **donated**, substitutions are not always possible
- Menus may change based on:
  - Availability
  - Surplus
  - Spoilage risk

Our goal is **consistency and equity**, not perfection.

## Reporting an Issue

If something comes up, please use the **Snack Program Reporting Form** whenever possible.  
Email is fine if the form does not capture what you need.

You can use the form to report:
- Food waste or feedback
- Dietary or allergy concerns
- Field trips or large numbers of absences

### What to expect after submitting

- You will receive an **email confirmation** from one of the volunteers
- We may follow up if clarification is needed
- Not every submission will result in a visible change, but all are reviewed
