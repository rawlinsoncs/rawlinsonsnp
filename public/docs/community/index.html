<h2 id="what-is-the-student-nutrition-program">What Is the Student Nutrition Program?</h2>
<p>The Rawlinson Student Nutrition Program (SNP) provides a <strong>daily snack to every student</strong> at the school.</p>
<p>Students can receive a snack <strong>regardless of whether a family has submitted an opt-in form</strong>.<br>
This approach helps ensure all students are supported during the school day.</p>
<p>The program exists to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support student wellbeing</li>
<li>Promote equitable access to food</li>
<li>Reduce barriers for families</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-the-program-works">How the Program Works</h2>
<p>The Student Nutrition Program is supported through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public funding</li>
<li>Food donations</li>
<li>Community support</li>
</ul>
<p>Much of the program is run by <strong>volunteers</strong>, with support from school administration.</p>
<p>Because a significant portion of the food is <strong>donated and perishable</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Menus may change week to week</li>
<li>Substitutions are not always possible</li>
<li>Items are sometimes prioritized to reduce waste</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is <strong>consistency and equity</strong>, not perfection.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-does-the-snack-include">What Does the Snack Include?</h2>
<p>Each snack day includes <strong>two components</strong>, following Student Nutrition Program guidelines:</p>
<p><strong>1. Vegetables or fruit</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. One of the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Whole grain products</li>
<li>Protein foods</li>
<li>Milk or milk alternatives</li>
</ul>
<p>Specific items vary depending on availability, seasonality, and food safety requirements.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="nutrition-standards">Nutrition Standards</h2>
<p>All snacks follow nutrition standards set by the TDSB and the City of Toronto.</p>
<p>These standards include guidance around:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sugar and sodium limits</li>
<li>Whole grain ingredients</li>
<li>Appropriate food categories for student nutrition programs</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dietary-needs-and-allergies">Dietary Needs and Allergies</h2>
<p>We take dietary needs and allergies seriously.</p>
<ul>
<li>Students with allergies or medical dietary needs receive <strong>appropriate substitutions</strong></li>
<li>Temporary dietary needs (for example, related to religious observance) can be accommodated when possible</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Allergy or medical concerns must be communicated <strong>in writing</strong> through the school</li>
<li>Allergy concerns cannot be lifted based on verbal requests alone</li>
<li>If a student does not receive a substitution item, their dietary needs do not require one</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have questions about your child’s dietary needs, please contact the <strong>school office</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-the-program-is-funded">How the Program Is Funded</h2>
<p>The Student Nutrition Program is supported through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public funding</li>
<li>Food donations</li>
<li>Community contributions</li>
</ul>
<p>Donated food often includes fresh, perishable items such as fruit and dairy.<br>
Additional items may be purchased to supplement donations when needed.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-families-can-help">How Families Can Help</h2>
<p>Families can support the program by:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9vXzS8igf1ctnruGFHIYfP6KN_mPStFYAoPrZKV8o9Lds9g/viewform?usp=header">Volunteering time when possible</a></li>
<li><a href="https://tfss.ca/donate/schoolsites-snp/">Making financial contributions</a> (Receipts available for donations over $10)</li>
<li>Sharing accurate information within the community</li>
<li>Expressing appreciation for volunteers and staff</li>
</ul>
<p>Every form of support helps keep the program running smoothly.</p>

<h2 id="how-snack-distribution-works-behind-the-scenes">How Snack Distribution Works (Behind the Scenes)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Student Nutrition Program serves approximately 720 students every school day, five days a week.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Providing a daily snack at this scale requires coordination, care, and consistency. Below is a look at how the program runs each day and where volunteers are involved.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="daily-snack-distribution-morning">Daily Snack Distribution (Morning)</h3>
<p>Snack distribution happens every school day and is designed to be efficient, predictable, and finished before classes begin.</p>
<p><strong>Around 8:20 a.m., volunteers arrive at the school.</strong><br>
They collect the snack bins used the previous day and lay them out in order by classroom. If a bin is missing, it is replaced so every class is accounted for.</p>
<p><strong>All bins are sanitized.</strong><br>
Before any food is added, bins are cleaned and prepared for use.</p>
<p><strong>Snacks for the day are gathered from storage.</strong><br>
Food is retrieved from the pantry or refrigerators. On some days, fruit or vegetables need to be washed or portioned by weight before distribution.</p>
<p><strong>Snacks are carefully portioned by classroom.</strong><br>
Items are counted out based on class size. Depending on what is served, this may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An apple and a cheese string</li>
<li>A yogurt or fruit cup, <strong>plus a disposable spoon for every student</strong></li>
<li>Bread sticks with WOW butter, alongside fruit</li>
</ul>
<p>Quantities are adjusted on the fly if supplies are limited, ensuring every class receives what they need.</p>
<p><strong>Dietary alternatives are added.</strong><br>
Students requiring substitutions receive them in <strong>clearly labeled bags placed inside classroom bins</strong>. These alternatives vary depending on the snack being served that day.</p>
<p><strong>Bins are distributed.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kindergarten bins are delivered directly to classrooms</li>
<li>All other bins are placed on tables near the office for teacher pickup</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cleanup happens immediately.</strong><br>
Cardboard is broken down and placed in recycling, and the space is reset.</p>
<p>The goal is for all distribution to be complete by <strong>approximately 9:15 a.m.</strong>, so snacks are ready when classes need them.</p>
<p>Volunteers are onboarded before helping, and <strong>no food handling certification is required</strong>. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9vXzS8igf1ctnruGFHIYfP6KN_mPStFYAoPrZKV8o9Lds9g/viewform?usp=header">Complete the volunteer form for more information</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="moving-food-deliveries-a-separate-volunteer-role">Moving Food Deliveries (A Separate Volunteer Role)</h3>
<p>Moving food deliveries is a distinct task from daily distribution and is often handled by different volunteers.</p>
<p><strong>What this role involves</strong></p>
<p>Food deliveries are signed for by office staff but arrive on the <strong>main floor</strong>. Volunteers then move items to appropriate storage locations, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The pantry on the second floor</li>
<li>Refrigerators in the lunchroom for dairy and other perishables</li>
</ul>
<p>Deliveries can include <strong>dozens of cases</strong> containing items such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apples or other fruit</li>
<li>Yogurt tubes</li>
<li>Granola bars or cereal products</li>
<li>Individually packaged snacks</li>
</ul>
<p>Cases can range in weight from <strong>a few pounds up to approximately 45 pounds</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Delivery timing varies by vendor</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>TFSS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Deliveries are moving to Wednesdays between <strong>11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m.</strong></li>
<li>Arrival times can be unpredictable and may fall outside the delivery window</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Healthy Selections</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Delivery dates are selected by the SNP coordinator</li>
<li>Deliveries typically arrive within the agreed-upon window</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Millennium Bakery</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Delivers reliably on Wednesday mornings</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because dairy and other perishable items need to be refrigerated as soon as possible, timing matters.</p>
<p>Volunteers helping with deliveries are onboarded, and <strong>no food handling certification is required</strong>. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9vXzS8igf1ctnruGFHIYfP6KN_mPStFYAoPrZKV8o9Lds9g/viewform?usp=header">Complete the volunteer form for more information</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h3>
<p>Providing a daily snack to <strong>over 700 students</strong> helps reduce hunger, supports focus in the classroom, and contributes to a calmer learning environment for everyone.</p>
<p>The process is well thought out and reliable. It works because of community involvement.</p>
<p>Volunteering offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>A meaningful way to support students</li>
<li>A first-hand look at how Rawlinson operates day to day</li>
<li>A tangible way to strengthen the school community</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not about fixing a broken system — it is about <strong>showing up for students together</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="interested-in-helping">Interested in Helping?</h3>
<p>If you are curious about volunteering — whether with daily distribution, moving deliveries, or behind-the-scenes support — learning more is a great first step.</p>
<p>You do not need special training, just a willingness to help.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9vXzS8igf1ctnruGFHIYfP6KN_mPStFYAoPrZKV8o9Lds9g/viewform?usp=header">Complete the volunteer form for more information</a>.</p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="can-families-request-specific-snack-items">Can families request specific snack items?</h3>
<p>Families are welcome to share feedback, but specific items cannot be guaranteed.<br>
Availability, safety requirements, and nutrition guidelines determine what can be served.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="why-dont-we-serve-certain-foods">Why don’t we serve certain foods?</h3>
<p>The school does not have a food preparation kitchen or food handling certifications.</p>
<p>For safety reasons, this limits what foods can be served through the program.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="who-runs-the-student-nutrition-program">Who runs the Student Nutrition Program?</h3>
<p>With the exception of school administration support, the program is run primarily by <strong>volunteers</strong>, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Program coordination</li>
<li>Snack packing and distribution</li>
<li>Managing dietary substitutions</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="who-should-families-contact-with-questions">Who should families contact with questions?</h3>
<p>Please contact the <strong>school office</strong> for questions related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dietary needs</li>
<li>Allergies</li>
<li>Program participation</li>
</ul>
<p>This helps ensure information is shared safely and consistently.</p>
